Create a project folder. Navigate in there on terminal.
npm init -y, make sure it made package.json. Make sure “main” is set to “index.ejs”.
npm install express --save, make sure it made the node_modules folder.
npm install ejs —-save, npm install body-parser —save.
Check package.json dependencies.
Create a server.js
On server.js
	require express, path, body-parser (to handle form data)
	invoke express as var app.
	use bodyParser.
	set up ejs and views folder route (because I’l need to echo stuff out in a view).
	require a route file in another folder.
		make a routes folder
		create index.js to contain all the routes.
			route root to be index.ejs view (form page)
			route post data object to result and render view.
	tell the express app which port to listen on.
Create views folder to house the index.ejs(form) and result.ejs (use <%= %> to echo out pieces of data.
Run “nodemon server.js” in terminal to start server.
Test by filling out form and seeing if it redirects to result view with the data you just inputted.
